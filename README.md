# Bidding-Desktop-App
This Project allows user to put their items for bidding as well as users can buy those items. This is a basic GUI app to meet the needs.
User must register themselves first via Register page by putting valid credentials such as email, password and create a personalised unique user name for themselves.Data gets validated
via database and prompts the user if it already exists.
Further users can search for their items on Buy page.The search feature searches all relevant products on the basis of key words and shows the user its present bidding price below
which users can bid for it and timer upto which the product is for sale.
It also allow users to update their balance and also show the current situation i.e. max bid put on their products via a table.
Users can sell their items on selling page.
We also created a basic server so as to remove items from sale whenever time for sale ends.
